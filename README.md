# Vasagar - Library Management System

Vasagar is a simple console-based library management system built using Java. This project is designed to manage a library's resources by allowing users to perform actions based on their account roles (Librarian or User). The system is user-friendly and follows the MVVM architecture.

## Features
### User Roles:

    Librarian:
        * Manage books (add, update, delete, or search).
        * View and manage user accounts.
        * View all borrowed books.
    User:
        * Search for available books.
        * Borrow and return books.
        * View the list of books they have borrowed.

## Key Features:

    * User account-based access (Librarian and User roles).
    * Simple interface for managing books.
    * Book borrowing and returning functionality.
    * Efficient management of library resources using Java Collections.
